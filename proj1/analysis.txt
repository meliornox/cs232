Selected system calls from running strace on the prank program in this folder:

access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    Checks whether the program can access the file at filename.
    Returns 0 for success, -1 for error.  When an error is encountered it is
        recorded in errno.

alarm(5)                                = 0
    Used in the program, triggers an alarm after specified number of seconds
        have elapsed.
    Returns how many seconds until the next scheduled alarm, 0 since there were
        none.

close(3)                                = 0
    Closes the file referred to by the signifier so it may be reused.
    Returns 0 for success, -1 for error.  When an error is encountered it is 
        recorded in errno.

pause()                                 = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be restarted if
    no handler)
    Used in the program, pauses until a signal is intercepted.
    Doesn't return (seen here) unless the signal is not caught or the 
        signal-catching function did not return.

write(1, "No, YOU'RE annoying\n", 20No, YOU'RE annoying)   = 20
    Writes the buffer (the message) to file (1=console) up to the number of 
        bytes in the last parameter.
    The second "No, YOU'RE annoying" is the printout to console writing as the 
        system call that prints it is recorded.
    Returns the number of bytes written, -1 for error.  When an error is 
        encountered it is recorded in errno.
